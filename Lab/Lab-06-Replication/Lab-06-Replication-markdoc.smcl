There is a 14% chance of this occurring. This outcome seems small, but if you graph the binomial distribution with the parameters n=50 and p=.08, you will see that k=40 actually has the highest liklihood of occurring. You can do this easily in Stata:

> 14f. The results of the Shapiro-Wilk test (W=0.983; p=0.000) indicate that variable HRNUMHOU is not normally distributed. The results of the Shapiro-Francia test (W'=0.983; p=0.000) indicate that variable HRNUMHOU is not normally distributed. It is important to note that the variable HRNUMHOU violates the assumptions for both tests. The sample size for HRNUMHOU is so large that even the most minute deviations from normal will result in a statistically significant result on both tests. They should therefore not be factored into any decision about the normality of HRNUMHOU.
> 
> 14g. This question was not asked, but if you were asked to weight all of the information before you about the normality of the variable HRNUMHOU, you would disregard the information from the Shapiro-Wilk and Shapiro-Francia tests. Instead, you would focus on the bulk of the evidence (the skew, kurtosis, and the p-p plot), all of which point to a variable that is approximately normally distributed. On the whole, these could be argued to outweight the evidence of the q-q plot, which does suggest some deviations from normal.
